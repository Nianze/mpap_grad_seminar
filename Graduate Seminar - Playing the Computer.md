## Interest group:

- Music Production, Sound Recording, and Acoustics (sampling, sequencing, recording, etc...)
- Hardware and Software Design and Application (build tool that makes music, new instruments, new plug-ins, etc...)
- Computer music and Interactive Systems (generate music using programs/ml ...)
- Immersive audio for XR Environments (AR/VR, audio 3D reconstruction ...)
- Music Informatics (Brian, music analysis, information retrieval, ...)
- Music Cognition (more on the psychology side, perception study)

    - pop music -> need to be popuplar or it fails
    - new music -> for fun for oneself, popular or not doesn't matter; just to make oneself happyxs

## Immersive Sound
- Agnieszka Roginska

### what is immersive sound:
    
- 3000 B.C. in finding good place for cave painting using sound
- theater sound (theatrophone) -> spotify in 18th cent.
- how do we hear in 3D: sound localization 
    - using time difference for low freq. cue, -> determine left/right
    - using block/lack of signal for high freq. cue -> determine left/right
    - every direction has a slightly different EQ due to shape/structure of outer ear-> determine the up/down, front/back

### reproduction methods

binaural <- extended headphones <- binaural over 2 speakers <- surround sound(4 channels) <- surround sound with height <- soundfield <- multi-speaker (can rotate and hear differeces now) <- object-based audio <- wavefield synthesis <- 

Current projects:
- NYU Holodeck
    - collaborative physical/virtual environment
    - acoustics adaptation
    - evolve how we make, rehearse, perform and distribute music
- CityTones
    - crowd-sourced database of ambisonic environmental recordings with metadata
- AES 147: Game audio & XR
