# Potential Computer Applications in Music Production

## 1. Introduction

Since music industry has entered the digital age, the computer has become more and more important in music production and hugely changed the way of producing the music. In the light of this trend, this article aims to explore the potential computer applications in the field of music production: to treat the computer not only as a tool that helps musicians in the early phase of music production or final stage of music recording/reproducing, but also as a source of inspiration during music composition highlighting  possible creative variation exploration, as well as a new kind of "instrument" in the context of live music performance.

## 2. Computer as the composition aid

There are two kinds of creativity: genius and hard work (Jacob 1996). Since its nature of rarity and unintelligible, genius is not a good model for computers to learn from. On the other hand, however, it is ideal for computers to follow certain rules or patterns to explore the gigantic tedious boring stuff that could drain up one's energy easily - that's exactly the area where algorithmic composition could take place and help strengthen composers to a more efficient creative workflow. 

Good art pieces, such as music, sculpture, dance or poetry, usually reveal some implicit patterns behind the scene that's intrinsic as part of the creator's mindset. If there's a way to express and to transform this implicit mindset into the form of explicit algorithm, and to let computer generate heuristic creative seeds automatically, then the creator could explore a much larger search space for possible outcomes. It's like an extremely efficient team doing brainstorm. Given a source piece, algorithmic compositions are able to create variations on top of a previous version of variation, eventually generating some completely new piece that goes so far from the original point that we can regart it as a creative process - which is exactly how the "hard work" creative process goes through: by continuous iteration and revision.

Of course, a successful iteration requires some critical conditions before reaching to the final pleasing result: the iteration algorithm needs to have a "good taste" that matches composer's aesthetic. This match is non-trivial, and chances are that different composers need to create their own unique algorithm to align the iteration update with their own taste and methodology. Algorithmic composition, in this sense, acts like politics:  composer takes use of it but still needs to find their own path.

## 3. Computer as the live instrument

Nowadays commercial performing software, such as Ableton Live or Reason, aims for live performance with a well-defined GUI interface. In some sort of sense, we can already regard the computer running performing software as a basic instrument. However, the music pieces in such performing software is usually pre-recorded/pre-generated, and performers/DJs typically improvise with the mixing and sound effects of the original music pieces to create live performance, in contrast to the traditional understanding of instruments, where the sound is created on the fly during the performance. To make a computer more like an instrument, there are ways to generate and manipulate the music in the real time.

### 3.1.Live coding

Without being constrained by the rigid GUI interface of Ableton Live or Reason, live coding focus on controlling audio using scripting languages such as Perl, Ruby, SuperCollider, etc (Collins 2003).

A special event called "algorave" is invented by the laptop music duo "Slub", where group members Alex McLean and Nick Collins take use of their self-crafted software to generate music and improvise the sound on the fly by manipulating the code in the real time, which is a home-made interpreted language featuring assembly-language-like syntax. During the algorave, the laptop screens are usually projected to a large wall so that audience could appreciate the quality of the code as well as the live music generated out of the code, similar to looking at a pianist playing the piano, or violinist moving the bow during the performance.

One of the interesting thing about live coding is that, by manipulating the code in the real time, the performance is always open to errors and glitches, which, in turn, is allowed to occur and is appreciated as a form of slub music aesthetic.

Apart from using home-made tools like slub, there are attempts of building open-source audio programming languages that aims for real-time generative and interactive music. One of such attempts is SuperCollider, where various useful libraries, such as Just in Time Library, or jitlib, is contributed by the SuperCollider global community to make the language more and more powerful and reliable in live coding performance.

### 3.2. Laptop orchestra

Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) explores the field of laptop as live instruments, focusing especially on using laptop in the context of the orchestra (Trueman 2007).

Needless to say, the two words, "orchestra" and "laptop", seems conflicting in the first glance: orchestra is large and traditional, consisting of instruments under refinement for centuries; "laptop" only got invented in the recent decades and is usually used alone, while still in the phase of rapid evolving nowadays. To merge the two oppositing concepts together, challanges could also be regarded as opportunities.

Specifically, PLOrk has 15 performance stations, relatively small in the eye of traditional orchestral perspective, but large enough as an exprimental band in hope of creating the new form of art. Each station, originating from an instrument called the Bowed-Sensor-Speaker-Array (BoSSA), consists of

* a specialised speaker, 
* a laptop with varying software (including Max/MSP, ChucK and SuperCollider), 
* a multi-channel audio interface
* a sensor interface supporting idiosyncratic control mechanisms
* a variety of other interface devices, including keyboards, graphics tablets, and drum pads

Nowadays as computers become more and more accessible and single-user production studio gets more and more pervasive, one of the valueable features shines from PLOrk's laptop orchestra exploration is to form a collaborative activity: its inherent dependence on people making music together in the same space, showing exciting possibilities of the face-to-face creative atmosphere.

## 4. Conclusion

After exploring three different attempts of applying computers into new fields of music production, it could be seen that the computer, either as a composition aid or as an instrument, still needs a lot of refinement before really shining in these new areas. As computation cost becomes lower and lower according to Moore's Law, computer is promising in taking more part of music production, and offering more creative help in unexpected forms. We might even expect the smartphone to take part in this field and bring new possibilities thanks to its small size and various embedded sensors.
